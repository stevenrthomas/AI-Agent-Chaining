- **AWS Region:** us-east-1
- **Models Used:**
  - Architecture: Claude 3 Sonnet (`anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`)
  - Development: Claude 3 Haiku (`anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`)
  - Testing: Amazon Nova Lite (`amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`)

## üîç Performance Insights

### Key Findings:

1. **Python Dominance:** Python achieved the best overall performance (37.18s), demonstrating excellent efficiency with the `pydantic-ai` library and async processing.

2. **C++ Consistency:** C++ showed consistent performance across all stages with the smallest variance, indicating stable execution characteristics.

3. **Node.js Variability:** Node.js had the highest variance, particularly struggling with the Architecture stage (27.88s vs 13.61s for C++), suggesting potential network or SDK efficiency differences.

4. **Model Response Consistency:** Nova Lite (Testing) was consistently the fastest across all languages (5.19-5.97s), while Claude Sonnet (Architecture) had the highest variability (13.61-27.88s).

### Technical Factors:

#### Language Overhead:
- **Python:** Minimal overhead with optimized async libraries
- **C++:** Low-level efficiency but higher SDK initialization costs
- **Node.js:** V8 engine efficiency with potential event loop delays

#### SDK Integration:
- **Python:** `pydantic-ai` provides streamlined Bedrock integration
- **C++:** Direct AWS SDK integration with comprehensive error handling
- **Node.js:** Official AWS SDK with promise-based architecture

#### Network Performance:
- All implementations use identical AWS credentials and region
- Variations likely due to connection pooling and SDK-specific optimizations
- Python's `pydantic-ai` may have superior connection management
