# Running the Go Implementation

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Go**: Download and install Go from https://golang.org/dl/
   - Minimum version: Go 1.21
   - Add Go to your system PATH

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

## Setup and Run

1. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Archive\Projects\AWS Bedrock 1.0"
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Run the Implementation**:
   ```bash
   go run game_pipeline.go
   ```

## Key Features of Go Implementation

- **Context-based execution** with proper cancellation support
- **AWS SDK for Go v2** native integration
- **Environment variable management** using godotenv
- **High-precision timing** with `time.Since()`
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed failure reporting
- **Structured logging** and formatted output
- **Memory efficient** with minimal allocations

## Troubleshooting

1. **Go not found**: Ensure Go is installed and in your PATH
2. **Module errors**: Run `go mod tidy` to resolve dependencies
3. **AWS credentials**: Ensure .env file contains valid AWS credentials
4. **Network issues**: Check AWS region and Bedrock model access

Once you have Go installed, run the commands above to capture the timing data!
